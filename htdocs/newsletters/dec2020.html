        <p class="intro">  
        In November a record 4 of our portfolio companies signed or closed Series B rounds. The average valuation for these rounds was $125m, compared with $7m when we invested. We're excited to see the trajectory of these companies and will be sharing details as they announce the rounds.

        November also saw a near record number of technology companies filing for an IPOs. And a continued influx of capital chasing late stage technology companies. But these riches are not distributed equally. In this newsletter we chose four articles that highlight some of the trends we are seeing in the venture capital world.

            <b>Founders who are exceptional at raising capital have an advantage over entrepreneurs who aren't</b> as good at wooing VCs. (See How Venture Capitalists Are Deforming Capitalism.)

            And despite the abundance of capital available, <b>the best VCs are continuing to flourish</b> based on a virtuous cycle of picking well, branding well and offering access to powerful networks. (See Frogs and Princes)

            <b>But regardless of capital, at the end of the day the company with the best execution tends to win</b>, which is why Microsoft crushed the very well funded Slack. (See How Microsoft Crushed Slack)

            <b>And, lastly, crazy founders can be amazing - or terrible - or both</b>. You can decide which characterization better fits Tesla/SpaceX/Neuralink/etc. founder Elon Musk.(See Elon Musk's Totally Awful, Batshit-Crazy, Completely Bonkers, Most Excellent Year)

    <p class="title">1. How Venture Capitalists are deforming capitalism </p>
    <p class="desc">
      In this much talked about article from the New Yorker, Charles Duhigg argues the startup world has turned into a game where founders who can raise the most money win. He's not totally incorrect.  At the same time, this isn't a new phenomenon. Companies with deep coffers have always had a distinct advantage. What's changed is the means of financing: Instead of convincing banks their loans will be paid back, the new generation of entrepreneurs tell stories of promised riches. Sometimes they even deliver.

      "The best venture-capital firms resemble elite universities. Because the brightest turn up at their door, they are able to charge the highest fees. And those fees are mostly for the accreditation and the social networks that the institution can offer."

      When Ramy interned at Microsoft in 1999, Steve Ballmer gave a speech boasting that Microsoft may be second to market but first to execute. Twenty years later, he's still correct. (Salesforce saved the day.)
