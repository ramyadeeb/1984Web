<p class="intro" >Dear Investor,</p>
<p class="intro" >
  There are protests in the streets peacefully marching against systemic racism.  There is also a small minority causing violence and looting--some out of anger, others out of opportunism or need. Against this backdrop many Americans remain unemployed, yet the S&amp;P 500 has rallied to recoup most losses. And the tech community finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being the least affected, if not primary beneficiary, of the current economic crisis; while having to contend with a president who brilliantly mastered the use of their platforms to divide instead of unite.

  How did we get here?

<p class="intro" >
  It's not because of bat soup served in Wuhan, the inherent dangers of birdwatching or presidential twitter decrees. These issues: racism, inequality, tech and freedom of speech, all run much deeper.  We dedicate our newsletter to thought-provoking pieces on these issues.  We don't feign to fully understand, but we hope that this selection of articles will shed some light on how we got here.

  On the portfolio front, in May we held our first virtual Company Day, a half-day event over zoom for our portfolio founders to discuss and share advice on operations and fund raising.  Our last speaker of the day, Joel Peterson, Chairman of JetBlue, gave a particularly moving talk on leadership under crisis. His words couldn't be more timely. We include a 90-second excerpt of it below.

<p class="title" >1. The Dominos Of Racial Injustice by Trevor Noah </p>
<p class="desc" >
  The response to current events we've found most insightful and affecting is a self-recorded video by comedian and late-night host Trevor Noah.  “Hey, what’s going on everybody,” he begins. "You know what's really interesting about what's happening in America right now is that a lot of people don't seem to realize how dominoes connect, how one piece knocks another piece that knocks another piece and in the end creates a giant wave." And he knocks them down.

<p class="title" >2. While Twitter Confronts Trump, Zuckerberg Keeps Facebook Out of It </p>
<p class="desc" >
  What do you do when the US president uses your social media platform to spread misinformation? This month Twitter took the unprecedented step of adding a fact-check link to one of Mr. Trump's tweets.  Facebook meanwhile would not introduce similar measures. "I strongly believe that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online" said Mr. Zuckerburg.  In fairness, the two companies face a different set of challenges and consequences.  But choosing between the ire of your employees or the ire of the president is no fun. We do appreciate one thing Mark Zuckerberg said defending his position: "ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open."

<p class="title" >3. Section 230, The Internet Free Speech Law Trump Wants to Change, Explained </p>
<p class="desc" >
  After Twitter decided to fact-check Trump's tweet, the president signed an executive order threatening to weaken "Section 230" of the Communications Decency Act in an effort to fight back against the social media platforms he believes are unfairly censoring him and other conservative voices by.   A 30-year old law, Section 230 shields internet platforms from liability for what third parties say or do on them.  This post from Vox sheds light on the history and the intricacies of the law, and how moderating speech would actually increase liability.

  We leave you on a lighter note. A Former NASA Engineer has used a combination of physics and skillmanship to build the perfect squirrel-proof bird feeder, only to see the squirrels master it. As one comment on the video stated: "The internet was built for this."
