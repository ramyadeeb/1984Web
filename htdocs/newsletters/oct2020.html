        Who has ever heard of Snowflake? (In the Bay Area, they're known for their clever billboards.)

        But now the company is known for the biggest Software IPO in history and has driven investor appetite for enterprise SaaS to stratospheric levels. Its story is a case study in how the unsexy becomes sexy: A little-known company with solid unit economics becomes the darling of Wall Street (and Warren Buffet) overnight. The excitement of public markets seeps into the private markets. And suddenly enterprise SaaS becomes the darling of venture capital.

        We pride ourselves on disdaining hype. But what should we do when hype catches up with our portfolio? We stay the course. The fundamentals of SaaS are strong: low or negative customer churn, high gross margins and recession-proof revenue. And while the frothy public valuations have translated into higher prices for series B onwards, we have yet to see a significant uptick in seed valuations and continue to win the investments we want. Inevitably the public market will correct and attention will be diverted elsewhere. When that occurs, we'll continue to do what we do best: invest in software companies upended unsexy and antiquated industries.

        In Q3 we made four new investments: one in consumer (Zero Grocery, a green grocery delivery company that cuts out the wholesaler) and three in enterprise companies (Vectrix, a cloud security marketplace, Vizion, an API for ocean freight shipping, and Biocogniv, which provides AI-powered diagnostics for hospitals). Also this quarter two of our investments from earlier this year raised new rounds: SESO, the agriculture labor marketplace, raised a new round led by Founders Fund and NFX, and Posthog, which provides open source analytics software, raised a significant upround--details in our financials.

    <p class="title">1. IPOs are Back   </p>
    <p class="desc">
      Who wants to go public in a once-in-a-century Pandemic? Quite a few tech companies, it turns out.  In this thoughtful article, the Economist outlines two factors driving the rush: the pandemic has sped up a fundamental shift towards digital businesses, and rock-bottom interest rates have pushed investors to accept higher valuations. So are we in a bubble? It's not quite like 1999.  But there's a whiff of "irrational exuberance" in the air.

    <p class="title">2. Snowflake's Tremendous Sales and Marketing Spend </p>
    <p class="desc">
      Despite its high margins, Snowflake is losing money because of heavy spend on sales and marketing. In 2019 the company spent $125 million on sales and marketing for $97 million in revenue, resulting in a net loss of $178 million despite a gross profit of $45 million. So should investors worry? As this article from Stratechery points out, data warehousing is a sticky product sold to the C-Suite - which is expensive to accomplish. His conclusion: Snowflake is an attractive business not simply because of its eye-popping growth numbers, but also because, counterintuitively, its eye-popping losses signal the company is spending its capital wisely.

    <p class="title">3. Is The Office Finished ? </p>
    <p class="desc">
      Around the world workers, bosses, landlords and governments are trying to work out if the office is obsolete&mdash;and are coming to radically different conclusions. Silicon Valley is no exception. Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter, has come out saying the company's staff can work from home "forever" but Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix, says working from home is "a pure negative."  This thoughtful article from the Economist sheds light on a debate that will only become more acute once there's a vaccine.
