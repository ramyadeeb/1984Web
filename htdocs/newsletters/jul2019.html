<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">Dear *|FNAME|*,</p>
<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">
  In June we made two new investments. The first was in <a href="https://www.goproperly.com" style="color: #7EA3FF;text-decoration: underline;">Properly</a>, the company upending real estate in Canada through instant buy offers, and the second in Toolbox, a stealth company that won the HBS business plan competition.  The month culminated one of our most active quarters to date with six new investments and a number of markups, more below.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Thought blockchain was dead? Not so fast. Facebook is releasing a cryptocurrency called Libra. And heavyweight companies ranging from Visa to Stripe are working with the social media giant to build it from the ground up. Our take: Facebook's new crypto currency, which is tied to the dollar, is more geared to peer-to-peer payment than it is a parallel financial system.  Put simply: Libra is a competitor to PayPal, not a threat to Bitcoin. Want to know why Facebook would launch a cryptocurrency and how it works? Read On.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Often dubbed the "Queen of the internet," Morgan Stanley analyst turned venture capitalist Mary Meeker first published her internet report in 1995. Since then, the annual release of the report has been widely read throughout Silicon Valley. This year did not disappoint. It's a long read (333 slides) but fun. Key takeaways: With half of the world's population online, the growth of the internet is slowing down. On the other hand, e-commerce, gaming, employment and security all continue to grow at a rapid rate. The next frontier to watch? China and South East Asia.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Cloud Kitchens, restaurants focused on online delivery with no dine-in or takeaway options, are on the rise. Armed with cheaper rent and smaller staff, these kitchens can now deliver consumers' favorite meals within 30 minutes at the same price, or lower, than a restaurant. In this thoughtful piece, Sequoia's Mike Moritz articulates the potential impact on the restaurant industry - large chain and high-end restaurants might be insulated but the local trattoria, taqueria or curry shop will soon feel the pinch.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Ask leading companies what's disrupting their business and you will hear "technology." But in this thoughtful piece of research, HBS professor Thales Teixeira concludes that disruption is a customer-driven phenomenon. "New technologies come and go but the ones that stick around are those the consumers choose to adopt." In other words, Uber, Airbnb, Slack and Pinterest don't have access to better innovative technologies than the incumbents.  What they do have is an ability to build and deliver faster and more accurately exactly what customers want. Our thesis exactly.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Chinese investors were once embraced in Silicon Valley for their pocketbooks and their access to the Chinese market. Suddenly they're no longer welcome. Efforts by the US government to curtail talent and technology outflow culminated with the passing of FIRRMA in August, which restricts investment in sensitive technology. Some startups were forced to return invested capital and VC firms started shunning Chinese LPs. How it all ends remains unclear. Here's part of the reason why: "Many Washington policy makers don't understand technology and tech executives don't understand great power politics."

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  According to Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, going public today is associated with a short term focus - a skewed incentive system associated with quarterly earnings, activist investors and shrinking R&amp;D budgets. In June Ries got his wish when the SEC approved his plans for the Long Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), which would become the 14th US stock exchange, to help solve these problems. Ries isn't tilting at windmills, but will institutional investors or CEOs who have put their heart and soul into their companies take the leap and gamble on a new exchange? As Vox points out, the success of LTSE, "essentially relies on Wall Street buying into the idea. And Wall Street is not exactly known for running toward innovation."
