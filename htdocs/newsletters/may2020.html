  The COVID pandemic has exposed many shortcomings of our healthcare system. In our featured article below,  1984 healthcare partner (and active ER Physician) Farzad Soleimani shares his views from the frontlines.

  <b>Portfolio Update</b>
  <br>
  During the Great Recession, the advice we gave all our startups was to preserve cash. But this crisis requires a more nuanced response. At 1984 Ventures, we have instituted an operational framework based on impact to demand and cash position to guide our portfolio companies:  Startups where demand has struggled are aggressively preserving cash (and retaining existing customers), while businesses with increased demand are focused on opportunistics growth.

<p class="intro" >
  This month we made one new investment (to be announced) and participated in two follow-on rounds in portfolio companies: Flowspace, which automates eCommerce fulfilment, and Kyte, which provides on-demand car rentals delivered directly to consumers.  We have always been impressed with their execution and growth, and even more so during the crisis.

  <b>The Payment Protection Program</b>
  <br>
  On April 4th the government rolled out the Payment Protection Program (Which was fully exhausted by April 16th). We observed an intriguing association: Startups with strong cash reserves were much more successful in receiving the loan than startups with little cash.  The better-funded startups tended to have a dedicated CFO, stronger relationships with lenders, and were faster in applying.  The point of this story is not to focus on the teething pains of the bailout program (or to vindicate Milton Friedman, who famously quipped that “nothing is more permanent than a temporary government program”).  Rather it is to highlight that regardless of government intervention, crises often accelerate fates that were already in the making.

<p class="title" >3. It's Time To Build </p>
<p class="desc" >
  Part call-to-arms and part flogging over America's inability to build, Marc Andreesen's new essay garnered strong feelings in the tech echo chamber this month.  His thesis: the current crisis isn't just a result of a lack in preparation but also a lack of will to build.  (Mr. Andressen's seminal essay "Why Software Is Eating The World" from 2011 is a cornerstone of our investment thesis).  Fans hailed his new essay for its timeless aspiration, while foes called out the irony of a Venture Capitalist asking others to build the very low-margin, capital intensive businesses VCs avoid.

<p class="title" >How Tech Can Build </p>
<p class="desc" >
  In this thoughtful essay, Tech-Philosopher Ben Thompson from Stratechery offers one of the best commentaries on Marc Andreesen’s article.  “What I also sense in Andreessen’s essay, though, is the acknowledgment that tech too has chosen the easier path.. which means relying almost exclusively on software as the means of innovation.“

<p class="desc" >
  This month Apple and Google undertook the unprecedented step of interoperating Androids and iPhones to build a digital contract tracing API. The bluetooth-based system retains most of the data on users' phones and away from central databases.  Still, it poses a number of security and privacy concerns.  If you're curious whether or not it will work and what the implications are, this article from Electronic Frontier Foundation is a must read.
