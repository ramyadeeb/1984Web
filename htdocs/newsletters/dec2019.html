<p class="intro" >Dear Investor,</p>
<p class="intro" >
  With the presidential election less than a year away, microtargeting and fake ads have become the new hotbed of debate. But the poster child for fake ads and fake news, Facebook, has not backed down from its 'anything goes' policy. As this newsletter shows, the issue is nuanced, and the media's mob mentality against Facebook is dangerous in its own right. In honor of the ongoing debate, we dedicate our last newsletter of the year to fake news - both political and technological.

  November was also a very busy month for our portfolio as three of our companies signed term sheets for Series A rounds. (This isn't fake news!) We will be sharing the details once the rounds are announced.

  Without further ado, here are your must reads from November

<p class="title" >1. Why Everybody Is Freaking Out About Political Ads on Facebook and Google </p>
<p class="desc" >
  In response to the media onslaught on microtargeting, Twitter has banned all political ads (in what's effectively a PR stunt), while Google has banned 'Audience Targeting.' But are we having the right conversation? This thoughtful article from Vox sums up the variety of targeting techniques used by different media players. It concludes that the chatter about political advertising distracts from much bigger and more complicated problems: namely, the organic, not paid, content that often spreads disinformation.

<p class="title" >2. Tech and Liberty  </p>
<p class="desc" >
  With quotes from John Stuart Mill, the Federalists Papers, and some Supreme Court briefs, Ben Thompson jumps to the defense of Facebook with a simple message: "The original justification for the First Amendment was to avoid tyranny, and Facebook deciding what is or is not true would be exactly that—tyranny." He goes a little further and brings up a different type of tyranny, that of the prevailing opinion: "The media is so up in arms against Facebook that I find it deeply concerning that I might have any trepidation in writing that Facebook made the right decision". He leaves with a scathing message: "Tech specifically and the U.S. generally needs more free thinkers, not fewer. Mob mentalities, no matter their good intentions, leave little room for freedom of thought, and lots of room for the status quo." Hats off.

<p class="title" >3. Fake News in AI - How To Recognize AI Snake Oil </p>
<p class="desc" >
  In this short slide presentation, Princeton CS professor Narayanan breaks down the hype vs reality in AI. He separates AI applications into three areas: perception (image and voice recognition) where AI has made great strides, automating judgment (spam detection and content recommendations) where AI works well but is far from perfect, and, last, predicting social outcomes where AI is all hype and the outcomes are highly dubious.

<p class="desc" >
  Not to be restricted to innovation in tech, Silicon Valley gives us a different type of (very weird) diet--the dopamine fast, which requires abstaining from any rewarding activity. Since we're enjoying this too much, we're going to have to end here. Enjoy!
