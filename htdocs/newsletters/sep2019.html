<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">Dear *|FNAME|*,</p>
<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">
  In August we made two new investments.  The first is <a href="https://deepscribe.tech" style="color: #7EA3FF;text-decoration: underline;">DeepScribe</a> which transcribes doctor-patient conversations and uses advanced deep learning to generate notes directly into the medical records, and the second is in <a href="https://drivekyte.com" style="color: #7EA3FF;text-decoration: underline;">Kyte</a>, a company founded by former Uber employees to upend the car rental industry starting with the customer experience.

  Without further ado, here are your must reads from August.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Few companies have been as divisive as WeWork. The bull case: WeWork transforms real estate into a variable cost for all companies. The bear case: WeWork is led by an unaccountable executive looting it daily, and is running massive losses that will be fatal in the next recession. In this thoughtful piece, Ben Thompson of Stratechery argues that the bull and bear cases for WeWork have more in common than it seems: they are both a logical conclusion of effectively unlimited capital.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  In this thoughtful evaluation of the threat posed to the beef industry by Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat and "alt meat" more generally, the author's perspective can be summed up by his modern version of Gandhi's quote: "First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they sue you. Then they try to buy you. Then they copy you. Then they steal your shelf space. Then they put you out of business. Then you've won."

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  First we shared aparments. Then we shared cars. Now the sharing economy is making its way into clothing. And not just online: Some of the country's biggest brick and mortar retailers are following online startups into the cult of thrifting, casting aside long-held fears that selling secondhand goods would cannibalize the market for new ones.  (On a related note, we are closing an investment in Curtsy which helps gen-z buy and sell used clothing)

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Are Google employees spoiled brats earning hundreds of thousands of dollars while whining about flaws in their Utopia-like workplace, or are they facing real challenges as the company scales? You be the judge.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  You have been waiting for it. Researchers from Keio University in Japan have devised a wearable mechanical device that gives humans a moving, vertebrate tail. The air-powered appendage can be used to improve balance, much in the way that animals use their tails. It was a difficult decision, but we won't be investing.
