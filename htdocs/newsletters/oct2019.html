<p class="intro" >Dear Investor,</p>
<p class="intro" >
  Q3 was rather eventful. The rapid rise and fall of the WeWork IPO jittered the tech world. But  why was Adam Neumann's fall from grace so swift? As Connie Loizos of TechCrunch asked: "Neumann never exactly hid who he is or how he operates, so what suddenly sparked the ire of reporters — and investors — around the world?"
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  Like the Wizard of Oz, for years Neumann drew the attention of the world away from the man behind the curtain and focused it on his grand vision. But when the curtain was finally pulled back, the public markets and media took a hard look at business and the founder's unchecked control and didn't like what they saw.

  So does the Valley need its moment of reckoning: should checks and balances be put on CEOs from the early days of startups? We don't believe so. A founder's capacity to innovate and control is integral to the "creative destruction" process. And a Fortune 500 boardroom will simply drive a startup to mediocrity--if not bankruptcy. At the same time, a startup boardroom with few checks and a culture of backslapping is not acceptable in a public company--or in a multi-billion-dollar privately held company for that matter. Boardrooms must grow up with their companies. In the case of WeWork, it took too long and came too late. We need boardrooms to mature sooner.

  It was an eventful quarter for us at 1984 as well, but in a good way! We made four new investments, two of our companies raised subsequent up-rounds and one, Fairmarkit, which automates procurement for enterprises, has raised a large Series A giving 1984 our first seven-digit markup in a single startup.

<p class="title" >1. In The Dual-Class Shares Debate, The Big Exchanges Should Get Off The Sidelines  </p>
<p class="desc" >
  Adam Neumann's fall from grace was astonishingly swift. Even while his spending was fairly well-documented across time (as were his apparent conflicts of interest), he was suddenly humiliated for enriching himself, then ultimately kicked out of the corner office. What, exactly, changed and "in an ultimately unsurprising IPO filing had people coughing up their morning coffee?" In this thoughtful piece Connie Loizos argues that the culprit may have been the extreme dual-class share structure in WeWork's S-1 filing. And she calls on the exchanges to stand up and fix it.

<p class="title" >2. Neither, and New: Lessons from Uber and Vision Fund </p>
<p class="desc" >
  This is a long, reflective read from Stratechery ending with an insightful take on the Vision Fund. Because of its size, the fund is fixated on "big opportunities" in sectors like real estate and transportation while shunning pure software plays as "clean polished little companies." But as the public market has suggested, the "big" opportunities might turn out to be big in market size and capital needs but not returns. Instead, public investors are favoring these polished software companies with 70% gross margins.

<p class="title" >3. Google (Accidently) Shows Proof of Quantum Supremacy </p>
<p class="desc" >
  In an upcoming paper in Nature magazine (accidentally leaked to the web), Google researchers have demonstrated "quantum supremacy." They built a quantum computer and carried out in a smidge over three minutes a calculation that would take Summit, the world's current-best classical supercomputer, 10,000 years to execute. It's a significant milestone for computing.  Don't expect traditional computers to phase out quite yet--we are years away from commercially viable applications. Stil, expect a few quarters of quantum computing hype to ensue.

<p class="title" >4. The Next Big Reading Platform May Be Instagram  </p>
<p class="desc" >
  Many of us have lamented the near death of books--while anxiously browsing our phones. The New York Public Library may have the answer: put literature on Instagram stories. It's a fascinating experiment and it appears to be working.

<p class="title" >5. Seriously Facebook? Introducing Horizon, A "Virtual" Social Network  </p>
<p class="desc" >
  Mark Zuckerburg's obsession with virtual reality, starting with the acquisition of Oculus, has left many scratching their heads (ourselves included 🤫). But the vision is finally coming together--ish. In this video a legless avatar lady makes a cringe-worthy announcement of Facebook Horizon, a virtual interconnected world where your virtual avatar can meet other virtual avatars, hang out, play games, and build your own environment. It is so bad it's actually good!
