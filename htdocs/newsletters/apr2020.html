<p class="intro" >Dear Investor,</p>

<p class="intro" >
  We are unquestionably in trying times, when many business owners are losing their heads, and in some cases much more. We are also at a time of immense change: when rules of business are getting shattered, when consumer adoption of eCommerce and telemedicine has been catapulted forward by years, and when investor fear is creating opportunities. As Q1 comes to an end, we wanted to share more details with you on how we and our portfolio companies are dealing with the crisis.

<p class="title" >
  Our Portfolio
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  Being a founder is a lonely job. More so in times of a crisis. We are continuously checking in with our entrepreneurs to understand the immediate impact and to provide much needed founder therapy. While many are losing their heads working with their kids at home, almost all are able to continue their operations remotely.
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  Today, we consider startups distressed if they need to raise financing over the coming two quarters, particularly if they operate in a sector of the economy that's severely affected by the crisis.   To that extent:

<p class="intro" >
  We realize our startups are in a fortunate position cash-wise.  Still, our advice is to lower burn rate, explore different financing options, and prolong the runway further.  And most importantly to stay lean and nimble.

  Our Companies' Response to the Crisis
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  We have been inspired by the resourcefulness and speed with which our portfolio companies have responded to the crisis. Here are a few examples.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Trusted Health</b>, which connects nurses with hospitals, launched a <a href="https://www.trustedhealth.com/covid-19-resource-center" >resource center</a> for the nurse community. The company has also mobilized 200+ (and growing) nurses who are pre-credentialed, screened, and licensed to serve on the front lines of any hospital in the country within a matter of days.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Health Note</b> which collect documents and triages patient information before a healthcare visit launched a <a href="https://info.healthnote.com/demo/covid19-emergency-department.html" >Covid-19</a> module to improve patient screening effectiveness.  The COVID-19 module is already being piloted at hospitals and clinics across the US as part of their response to the crisis.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DeepScribe</b>, which provides transcription for physicians, launched the first telemedicine platform with automated note taking, more <a href="https://get.deepscribe.ai/covid19" >here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>CareSignal</b>, which provides remote monitoring for at-risk patients, launched a free <a href="https://www.caresignal.health/covid-companion" >Covid-19 companion</a> for health systems and a symptom tracker to monitor patients discharged at home or healthcare providers with possible exposures.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Kyte</b>, an on-demand car rental platform, has launched a <a href="https://drivekyte.com/blog/we-care-about-your-safety!" >contactless handover</a> process and introduced <a href="https://drivekyte.com/blog/introducing-flexible-long-term-rentals-with-kyte" >long term rentals</a>. The company has leveraged the crisis particularly well by utilizing unused inventory from car rental agencies for local transportation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Latchel</b>, which provides property management solutions, launched a <a href="https://latchel.com/coronavirus/" >portal</a> to help the property management industry stay on top of news affecting their businesses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Padsplit</b>, which addresses the affordable housing crisis, launched a <a href="https://padsplit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040581312-COVID-19-Resource-List-for-Members" >resource list</a> for its members, many of whom are likely to struggle with the loss of employment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sling Health</b> which provides remote care teams has launched a dedicated Covid-19 <a href="https://slinghealth.com/covid" >response</a> to offload administrative work from healthcare providers.
  </li>
</ul>

  What Will Happen in Venture

  <b>tl;dr</b> Late stage will suffer most and venture tourism will end.

      <p class="desc" >
        Even though many deals were done in March (three of our portfolio companies closed up-rounds this month), we anticipate volume to slow down as investors absorb the impact of the crisis and public market volatility trickles down to the private markets.

      <p class="subtitle" >Back to Basics</p>
      <p class="desc" >As happened in 2000 and 2008 (the two crises we have experience with), we expect late stage valuations to drop in the coming months. One of our investors, itself a large fund, quipped: <i>"It's the Series Bs and Cs that are keeping us up at night."</i> Hardest hit will be companies that were not traditionally a focus of venture—think low-margin businesses like scooters, or moonshot opportunities with speculative valuations. </p>

      <p class="subtitle" >End of Venture Tourism</p>
      <p class="desc" >
        Typically, non-traditional investors (hedge funds, corporate VC arms) will pull back from the market. Ditto for "tourist founders." A graduating HBS student put it succinctly: <i>"It's amazing how many of my friends have suddenly decided that a McKinsey job is a good idea."</i> The result is a higher signal to noise ratio across the board.

  Our Investment Focus

<p class="quote" >
  "Investing isn't about beating others at their game. It's about controlling yourself at your own game."
  <span class="subquote" >
    —Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor
  </span>
</p>
<p class="tldr" >
  <b>tl;dr</b> We're staying the course but proceeding with caution
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  In times of crisis, basic business indicators can become extraordinary, almost unrecognizable. Today grocery stores are reporting 80% week over week growth. Travel, hospitality and real estate transactions have come to a standstill. Not surprisingly, there's a rash of venture capital investment right now in healthcare and online collaboration tools.
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  These are obvious sectors to invest in—and ones where we are quite active already. But we are also wary of the hype and the promise of short term riches—we internally quip that Covid-19-at-home-testing is the new Blockchain. We call these "Toilet Paper" startups.  For a detailed explanation <a href="https://marker.medium.com/do-not-buy-toilet-paper-venture-investing-in-times-of-a-crisis-f80e6626e37" >see our article on investing in times of crisis</a>

<a href="https://marker.medium.com/do-not-buy-toilet-paper-venture-investing-in-times-of-a-crisis-f80e6626e37" ><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/21384644543e11817ae775d1e/images/2f69fdbb-4611-41d7-acbd-2993d1009582.png" alt="2f69fdbb-4611-41d7-acbd-2993d1009582.png" ></a>
<p class="i:tro">
  We are ultimately interested in sectors that will outperform over the long term.  A good example is eCommerce enablement.  These  startups might be unsexy in the immediate future as consumers tighten their belts.  When the economy recovers they will bounce back stronger, while the death of Macy's is here to stay.

<p class="title" >
  The Road Ahead
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  We don't wish to diminish the scale of the present difficulties, but neither do we believe that the future is gloomy. The world has just become more reliant on technology than ever before. Now it just needs to get back to work.
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  We hope you and your family are in good health.
