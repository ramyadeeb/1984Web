<p class="intro" >Dear Investor,</p>
<p class="intro" >
  At the beginning of this decade, one in ten consumers had a smartphone. We couldn't order an Uber or book an Airbnb, and making an international call was expensive and cumbersome. That all has changed. We now lead more connected and more convenient lives, all because of technology.
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  But technology's stellar record is not without its share of failed promises. Autonomous vehicles were supposed to arrive by 2020, yet seeing an autonomous vehicle on the road (outside of the Bay Area) is as rare as encountering a successful blockchain startup. Speaking of which, instead of upending the financial systems, many cryptocurrency schemes turned out to be little more than thin air. How do we reconcile technology's achievements over the past decade with its numerous strikeouts?
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  We believe the answer lies in hype. Marketers, venture capitalists, and even LPs love to hype the latest technical innovation as the thing everyone must have. But clever marketing does not solve for technical shortcomings or compensate for the lack of utility. And the more hype a sector receives, the more likely it goes bust. This decade was marred with examples—from Google Glass to scooters. Meanwhile, new applications that few envisioned have changed our lives and created massive wealth—from Uber pool and voice recognition to video conferencing.
</p>

<p class="intro" >
  At 1984 Ventures we choose to avoid hype altogether and focus instead on proven technologies with real-life applications, particularly when applied to antiquated, sleepy industries. Instead of chasing the latest scooter company, we chased the best supply-chain optimization startups. And instead of investing in blockchain for real estate, we focused on automating appraisals. This year a slew of top Series A investors backed these startups in significant uprounds.
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  Along the way we have built a strong brand with entrepreneurs and investors. And as we celebrate our second anniversary while embarking on the new decade, we couldn't be more confident in our strategy— avoid hype and invest in software-enabled (and high gross-margin) businesses.
</p>
<p class="intr">
  There's a lot to cover. For the year behind and the road ahead, here's our end-of-year letter.

        Being seed investors means getting down in the trenches with our entrepreneurs. In 2018 that meant helping with recruiting and strategy. In 2019, as our early portfolio companies matured, that translated to coaching them on fund raising and introducing them to the right investors.

      <p class="desc" >
        We prefer difficult conversations to asking comfortable questions and making opaque decisions. So expect us to get some flak for speaking our minds at times.  (In fact, our one "Do Not Recommend" rating in YC, next to a dozen "Highly Recommend" ratings, complained we pointed out too many flaws in the business plan.)

<p class="title" >The World in 2020</p>
<p class="desc" >
  We have always believed that the purpose of technology pundits is to make astrologists look respectable. And predicting the future is just hard (Unless it's our portfolio company Shelf Engine predicting how many tomatoes a grocery store will need to order!). So instead of speculating too much about the future we will focus on offering some thoughts about the present.

      <p class="desc" >
        VCs love unbundling: startups carving out profitable niches from larger players. It started with the unbundling of Craigslist into vertical sites for apartment hunting, furniture, and dating. Then we saw the unbundling of Excel. And now we are seeing the unbundling of Amazon through Shopify and the unbundling of YouTube via MasterClass and TikTok. Unbundling Facebook meanwhile would likely require a double-miracle: Elizabeth Warren becoming president and then managing to push her antitrust agenda through congress.

      <p class="subtitle" >The Margin-Valuation Adjustment</p>
      <p class="desc" >
        This year the public markets taught private investors a lesson: If a product has software margins (75%+), then valuing it at 10x revenue is fine. But products that do not produce software gross margins must be valued like similar, low-margin businesses. We expect venture valuations for low margin businesses to continue to decline over the year ahead.

        Corporate America is awash with cash (Buybacks represented the largest source of demand for US equities in 2019.) Some factors were temporary in nature: Tax cuts, Fed intervention, etc. But one is lasting: efficiencies brought by technology. And improvements in AI and ML are not slowing down—this year the accuracy of voice recognition matched human's for the first time.

        It's not clear which annoys the American public more: Trump's tweets or higher taxes. But no matter who's elected, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg will likely be favorite targets of the administration. Also, one piece of investment advice: if Democrats eject Trump from office, immediately short Twitter.</p>

<p class="title" >What This Means for Us</p>
<p class="subtitle" >1. Keep the Investment Pace</p>
<p class="desc" >
  We are roughly 60% through our 3.5-year investment period.  In addition to 15 new investments in 2020, we also plan on making a number of follow-on investments as ourportfolio companies raise subsequent rounds. Expect us to reach out with co-investment opportunities as they materialize.
</p>
<p class="subtitle" >2. Focus on Margins </p>
<p class="desc" >We strive to find the right balance between responding to public sentiment and being over-reactive. In this instance, we concur with the public market's verdict on low margin businesses and are applying a more critical lens when evaluating these startups.
</p>
<p class="subtitle" >3. Ensure Our Startups Can Weather a Storm </p>
<p class="desc" >
  We can't time a downturn. But we know what happens when it takes place: companies with 18 months of cash survive while the rest struggle. We continue to push our startups to raise a little more capital than they need and manage their burn thoughtfully.

A 1984 newsletter would not be complete without a ridiculous story from the tech world. We'd like to end this letter in keeping with that tradition but with a twist: Of these five news stories, four are real and one is fake news. We will let you guess which one it is, and we wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season!
