  <p class="intro">Dear Investor,</p>
  <p class="intro">
    July was a jittery month for the stock market: an escalating trade war and a Democratic debate that resembled a circular firing squad all led to a mixed market performance. But two tech stocks outperformed -  Shopify and Pinterest - both of which enable eCommerce and beat already high analyst expectations.  
  </p>
  <p class="intro">  
    And their success should not be a surprise. While internet usage and smartphone sales are inching towards the saturation point, eCommerce is growing at a healthy 16% year over year yet still only accounts for 10% of brick and mortar sales. Enabling eCommerce has been a core focus of 1984 Ventures from day one. It started with our first two investments, Flowspace and Because Market, and has continued all the way to recent investments like Frey and Postscript. How eCommerce is evolving is the theme of this month's newsletter.

    Without further ado, here are your must reads from July,

  <p class="title">1. Shopify and the Power of Platforms </p>
  <p class="desc">
    In this thoughtful read from Stratechery, Bon Thompson argues that Shopify, despite not having a consumer-facing brand, will become a threat to Amazon. His rationale: "Trying to replicate what Amazon has built up over decades, as Walmart has attempted, is madness. Amazon has the advantage in every part of the stack, from more customers to more suppliers to lower fulfillment costs to faster delivery. The only way out of that competition is differentiation which bubbles up from widespread opportunity (and churn!), like that created by Shopify, supported by an entire aligned ecosystem."

  <p class="title">2. Road-Tripping With the Amazon Nomads </p>
  <p class="desc">
    Most products on Amazon today are sold on and offline. A growing set can only be bought online. But a small set has taken a more precarious journey: first appearing on store shelves and then, as their retailers struggle, making their way online via a group of merchants called Amazon Nomads. These nomads travel the backroads of America searching clearance isles for the rare soap or coveted toy. Their job is not easy, as chronicled in this Verge feature article. They travel constantly, and at times aimlessly, and must endure the overwhelming feeling of being confronted with so much consumerism run amok. Our favorite line: "There's nothing quite like a clearance section for feeling the intensity and fleetingness of consumer desire."

  <p class="title">3. Farmers Earn More Money from YouTube Than From Their Crops  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    Tech and media have truly penetrated all parts of American society. Only about 2% of the US population is engaged in farming and even their way of life is changing. As Bloomberg points out, it's a "sign of the times when farmers make more money advocating for (the farming) industry on social media than actually farming." This quick read describes how farmers-turned-YouTubers are quintupling their income via social media.

  <p class="title">4. All About Direct Listing  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    First it was Spotify. Then came Slack. Now Direct Listing is all the rage. What is it exactly? And how is it different from an IPO? This thoughtful (and somewhat lengthy) overview from the Andreessen Horowitz blog explains and makes the case for Direct Listings. Even the jobs of Goldman Sachs bankers may be at risk.

  <p class="title">5. FaceApp Is The Future  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    Want to know what you're going to look like in the future? FaceApp is your answer. This New York Times article perfectly captures the whimsical fun of FaceApp that has made it a viral sensation while illuminating the privacy and geopolitical concerns that have led US senators to call for an investigation into the app. Our take: the article has a point. Americans have already given up their privacy rights to apps many times over - so we may as well enjoy getting a sneak peak of ourselves at age 100!
