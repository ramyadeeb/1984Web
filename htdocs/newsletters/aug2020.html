Dear Investor

As the TikTok drama unfolds, it’s easy to write off the Trump administration’s threat to shut off the video app as yet another episode in the US-China saga. But a deeper look reveals a broader trend. In June, following a border skirmish with next-door China, India retaliated in part by shutting off TikTok along with 58 other Chinese apps. And in July Slack decided to pursue antitrust action against Microsoft over the bundling of its Teams product not in the US, home to both companies, but rather in the European Union where regulators look more harshly on tech giants.

These stories may seem like disparate anecdotes, but they highlight a shared underpinning: the internet is becoming fragmented. A combination of government and company politics are creating four disparate internet models across the world: a US internet marked by freewheeling and innovation, a robust Chinese ecosystem behind a closed off wall, a European one hampered by regulation, and an emerging Indian model dominated by Jio that may soon be followed in other developing countries.

This fragmentation may serve various political interests but is costly to businesses and consumers. It is the subject of our newsletter for this month.

In July we made a new investment in Zero Grocery, the startup upending grocery delivery by cutting out middlemen and offering plastic free packaging. Also, our portfolio company Shelf Engine announced its Series A round led by GGV.

Without further ado, here’s your newsletter for August.

1. India, Jio, and the Four Internets
https://stratechery.com/2020/india-jio-and-the-four-internets/
In this thoughtful piece, Ben Thompson articulates the emergence of the four models of operating the internet and the pros and cons for each. Ben’s worry is not the US shutting off TikTok, which he considers a “response in kind” to China’s 23 years of walled off internet.  Rather it is the increased splintering in the non-China Internet, particularly the emergence of a European model that is “the worst of all possible outcomes.”

2. The TikTok War
https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/
In this thought-provoking article, Stratechery’s Ben Thompson argues that the Chinese government has long perceived itself to be in an ideological struggle with the US. The Trump administration is concerned about the data that China could capture via Americans’ widespread use of TikTok. Thompson points out that the reverse flow of information poses a greater danger: TikTok’s algorithm gives China the capability to clandestinely influence millions of Americans in a contest for America’s hearts and minds.


3. Bail in Twitter hack: $725,000. Tampa teen’s assets: $3 million in Bitcoin

Twitter suffered its biggest security lapse on July 15th when a hacker took control of 120 accounts including those of Joe Biden and Elon Musk and used a cryptocurrency scam to collect $180K. The hacker was able to access Twitter’s internal admin tools though a two-step process: he first gained access to twitter employees accounts using phone phishing (Twitter has been frustratingly opaque on the details). And then used these employees credentials to gain access to other accounts with admin tool access. The suspect is now under arrest but it appears will only face state level charges. Juveniles hackers have it easy!


4. TikTok and Microsoft’s Clock - I mean, WTF?
https://500ish.com/tiktok-and-microsofts-clock-c4c9fd082b89
Microsoft expounded on its interest in acquiring TikTok in a very unusual blog post that GV’s M.G. Siegler called “almost like a letter of fealty” to President Trump. In this hilarious piece, Siegler breaks down the blog post and reviews the range of issues that make a potential Microsoft-TikTok acquisition a singularly strange deal.
