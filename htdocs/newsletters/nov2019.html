<p class="title" >1. The China Cultural Clash </p>
<p class="desc" >
  It all started with a tweet from the general manager of the Houston Rockets supporting the protests in Hong Kong. Fast forward a few days and the NBA is censored and the streaming of its games canceled all over China. This summary by Stratechery's Ben Thompson, who lives in Hong Kong, is poignant and personal. He discusses the mishaps on both sides and showcases how TikTok, the Chinese social network taking the west by storm, manipulates its search results. He leaves us with a sobering question: Should the US permit widespread adoption of a social network that has demonstrated a willingness to censor content and is controlled by a country that has a radically different view of what constitutes free speech?

<p class="title" >2. The Great Public Reckoning </p>
<p class="desc" >
  Fred Wilson sums up the recent valuations shakeup in the public market: private markets irrationally applied SaaS valuations to software-enabled companies. His conclusion: "If the product is software and thus can produce software gross margins (75% or greater), then it should be valued as a software company. If the product is something else .. then it needs to be valued like other similar businesses with similar margins, but maybe at some premium to recognize the leverage it can get through software." As a firm with a focus on SaaS, we couldn't agree more.
