<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">Dear Investor,</p>
<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">
  February was an excellent month for 1984's portfolio companies. Reggora, which automates residential real estate appraisals, announced a $10m Series A led by Spark Capital. And Brace, which automates mortgage servicing, announced a $10M Series A led by Point72. We are proud to have been the first institutional check in both companies and are excited to see them scale.
</p>
<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">
  It also goes without saying that it has been a rough month for global public markets. As the US saw its first "community spread" cases of coronavirus and its first fatality, the S&amp;P plunged 11% in the last week.
</p>
<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">
  We understand the global economic concern but don't share the global panic. Historically, this type of virus has tended to burn off during summer months and the economy has bounced back after epidemics. Whether that happens here, particularly given pre-existing negative investor sentiment and the potential Democratic nomination of Bernie Sanders, is unclear. What is clear is that the virus has highlighted another problem: with social media, hysteria can spread faster than any virus.
</p>
<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 100;">
  In China, silencing news about the virus amplified the problem. In the US, a media industry hungry for clicks created a firehose of click-bait articles, exasperating fear.  And in much of the world, fake cures and coronavirus conspiracies flooded WhatsApp. As governments and users were left with a sense of panic, Jessica Lessin, founder of The Information, wrote, "I found myself in a strange place for the founder of a digital news business: longing for one primary avenue of truth and communication, say, the evening news."

  For that and more, here are your must read for this month!

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Historically the major economic threat from epidemics has been the anxiety-induced reluctance to spend, aka demand shock. But as this article from the Economist articulates, the efforts to contain Covid-19 are shutting factories and disrupting supply chains, in essence creating a shock to supply as well, and putting central bankers in unchartered territory.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  The Facebook-owned messaging app—private in nature, and un-policed in key ways—has become a potential conduit for dangerous misinformation about the outbreak around the globe, leaving users in fear and creating public health headaches for governments.

  Several 1984 portfolio companies like Reggora and Brace are riding the wave of proptech sweeping through America's real estate industry. This Economist article gives a clear snapshot of the state of play in some key emerging proptech trends.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Is there something "dystopian about an outbreak being used as justification for more surveillance?" This article from Vox delves into the range of technologies being used to fight the virus, and how coronavirus may lead to wider acceptance of tech that corrodes privacy.
