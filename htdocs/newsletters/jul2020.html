<p class="intro" >Dear Investor,</p>
<p class="intro" >
  When the world economy hit pause at the end of Q1, the overwhelming question was the shape of recovery. Optimists predicted a V, likening the pandemic to a prolonged winter blizzard. Pessimists argued for a U, comparing the pandemic to every recession before it. But it proved to be the wrong question. With technology stocks up 10% and the industrial Dow Jones down 10%, investors are realizing there’s no going back to the economy of 2019. Consumers have changed their behavior and, in doing so, the fortunes of companies.
</p>
<p class="intro" >
  In 2009 behavioral scientists at University College London set out to study a simple question: How long does it take to form a habit? Their results, which were published in the <a href="https://centrespringmd.com/docs/How%20Habits%20are%20Formed.pdf" >European Journal of Psychology</a>, showed that habit formation is a function of repetition, and that it takes the average human  66 days of repetition for a behavior to become automatic. So it is not surprising that what started as semi-novel consumer behaviors--from putting on a face mask at grocery stores to ordering online--are becoming enduring habits with profoundly varying effects.  The question is no longer what recovery looks like for the economy but rather what does the future look like for a given industry or a particular business.

<p class="intro" >
  For technology startups, these are thrilling times. Armed with technology and unencumbered by momentum, they are able to adapt to and empower these changes. There are still hiccups facing tech in the months ahead. We remain wary of the widening gap between the debt-fueled stock market on the one hand and the economic reality of the average citizen on the other. And a freeze in capital markets is not far fetched. But for all intents and purposes, 2020 will be the year internet connectivity became more important than oil supply. So what does the future hold? In this newsletter we look at some of the tech-fueled transformations across the globe.

  We hope you and your families are in good health.

<p class="title" >1. On Concerts: Welcome to Fortnite</p>
<p class="desc" >
  When it comes to impact from Covid-19, live concerts have it pretty bad. Enter Fortnite, the world’s most popular battle royale game, which decided to take over where live concerts left off.  In April, after being forced to skip Coachella, Rapper Travis Scott turned to Fortnite where he landed the biggest stage of his career: <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/if-the-travis-scott-astronomical-performance-proved-anything-its-that-fortnite-is-changing-the-game-and-music-industries-forever/" >12.3M concurrent players</a> watching him live. If you want to better understand the experience, Charles Holmes from Rolling Stone<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-989209/" style="color: #7EA3FF;text-decoration: underline;"> wrote about his attmpt </a>to play the game for the first time to watch the concert live. Shot three times, he finally found the concert venue, only to experience an event more akin “to an animated short film than a concert.” Fortnite, with its sensory assault, is an acquired taste. But as pundits pontificate on the rise of complex VR hardware to mimic real life, a simple battle royale may emerge as the closest (and weirdest) online equivalent to a large offline gathering. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYeFAlVC8qU" style="color: #7EA3FF;text-decoration: underline;">Watch Travis Scott Video →</a>

<p class="title" >2. On Companionship: Riding Out Quarantine With a Chatbot Friend.
</p>
<p class="desc" >
  America is lonelier than it has ever been. And AI chatbots have stepped into the gap of real human interaction. Replika, a digital companion, saw traffic double during COVID and a half million downloads in April, with users sending an average of 70 messages to the bot per day. How are people using Replika? “Some view their Replikas as friends. Others treat them as if they were romantic partners.” Loneliness does strange things to people.

  Fancy fundraising dinners, in person photo ops and kissing babies have become a thing of the past in the 2020 election. What’s replaced them? <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/4/21280962/joe-biden-fundraiser-tom-steyer-silicon-valley" >A 20 minute Zoom call that raised $4m from 25 people.</a> While politicians of all stripes likely welcome easier money, they may not like the billionaire tech activism that’s accompanying it.

<p class="title" >4. On Cities: From Vilnius to San Francisco </p>
<p class="desc" >
  From the pedestrianization of streets to the repurposing of public spaces, cities around the world are reshaping themselves to meet the needs of their citizens. But as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/06/coronavirus-pandemic-urban-suburbs-cities/612760/?utm_source=CB+Insights+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=e96a6ce53c-newsletter_general_Tues_20200616&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_9dc0513989-e96a6ce53c-90979337" >this read from the Atlantic</a> argues, the legacy of the coronavirus remains unclear still. Will this pandemic, like those before it, inspire a new blueprint for urban planning or will it drive people away from cities for good? We don’t know.  But we do know that tech firms are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-tech-firms-rethink-san-francisco-silicon-valley-stands-to-gain-11592308801" style="color: #7EA3FF;text-decoration: underline;">rethinking San Francisco</a>.  Just a few months ago, SF-based technology firms referred to their Silicon Valley neighbors as dinosaurs from a bygone era. But a combination of far-left policies that are <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/san-francisco-progressive-leaders-ignore-everyday-citizens" style="color: #7EA3FF;text-decoration: underline;">“Too San Francisco for San Francisco,”</a> remote work technology, and a pandemic may spell a reversal of fortune for our beloved city by the bay.

<p class="title" >5. Unsubscribe: The $0-Budget Movie That 'Topped The US Box Office' </p>
<p class="desc" >
  Where movie studios saw disaster, two people saw opportunity. With movie theaters around the country sitting empty, Eric Tabach and Christian Nillson decided to see if they can reach the top of the box office. With a budget of $0 and five days of Zoom footage, they accomplished a ridiculous feat that would have taken tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in a pre-COVID world.
