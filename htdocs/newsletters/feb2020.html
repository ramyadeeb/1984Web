<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 200;">Dear *|FNAME|*,</p>
<p class="intro" style="font-size: 15px;line-height: 22px;font-weight: 200;">
  It was a busy start to the year in the tech world, highlighted by Visa's $5.3B acquisition of Plaid. It was also a busy month for our portfolio, as three of our investments raised their series A rounds--from GGV, Point72, and Lee Fixel/Addition Capital. Round details to follow once the companies make them public.

  On a somber note, this month saw the passing of HBS professor Clay Christensen, a teacher and mentor to many in our industry, including our very own Aaron Michael. Mr. Christensen was one of the most influential management thinkers of our time, and also the antithesis of Silicon Valley's over-hype culture. In his honor we dedicate our newsletter to disruption, the central thesis of his most famous book "The Innovator's Dilemma."

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  In "The Innovator's Dilemma", Mr. Christensen posited that it is the rationality of big firms--rather than their stupidity--that prevents them from foreseeing disruption.  At the time of its publishing in the 90s, his insight was as radical as it was inspirational; it gave startups the confidence that even the best-run incumbents could be overthrown.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  Sometimes the answer to disruption lies in the age-old adage: if you can't beat them join them (or in Visa's case, gobble them up.) This article from Stratechery explains what the enigmatic company Plaid does, and lays out a compelling vision for the acquisition: a new financial network, with Visa at its center, transforming the consumer financial services industry just as the credit card transformed the consumer retail industry.

<p class="desc" style="margin: 0 0 66px;line-height: 24px;">
  You think the Russian hacking of facebook ads was problematic? How about a world where candidates running for Congress solely rely on a social network based in China. As Tik-Tok takes hold among gen-z, its first election test may be right around the corner.
