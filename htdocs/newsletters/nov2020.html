        In June, Bill Barr, the U.S. attorney general, claimed there is "anti-conservative bias in the tech industry." Many ignored his comments as Trump administration saber-rattling. But he followed through. This month the government filed an antitrust case against Google (in what may be the most important tech lawsuit since the US government sued Microsoft nearly two decades ago). Notably Mr. Barr's case wasn't just backed by conservatives; it had the backing of Elizabeth Warren, the democratic presidential nominee, who has also been calling for Barr's removal.

        To paraphrase Jim Messina, you know Big Tech has screwed up its politics when Elizabeth Warren is finding common cause with Bill Barr and Ted Cruz. How the left and the right are united in their distrust of big tech is the focus of this newsletter.

        But antitrust legislation is not necessarily bad news. When the Reagan administration broke up AT&T (to the dismay of many in the industry), the cost of telecommunication neared zero and a myriad of new technology companies were born.  No matter who wins in the presidential contest tomorrow, big tech will remain in the crosshairs for a long time, albeit for different reasons. And more competition is better for consumers--and for small tech.

    <p class="title">2. How Facebook Works for Trump </p>
    <p class="desc">
      "Trump was not elected because of misinformation, but because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period".  Quipped Andrew Bosworth, head of Facebook ads during the 2016 election. This article from The Atlantic earlier this year explains how advertising has evolved from targeted audiences into Facebook's AI-driven "custom audiences" and its ramifications for advertising and politics.  The democrats won 2012 with target advertising.  Republicans won 2016 with the help of look-alike campaigns.  Who wins 2020 will be decided tomorrow.  But how they won it will take a few months to unwrap.
